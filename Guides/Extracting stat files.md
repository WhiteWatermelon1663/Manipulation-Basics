Sup!

You can extract stat files yourself, so you dont need to rely on other people anymore.

For this you **NEED** OpenIV, if you dont already have this installed, you can install it from:
https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/blob/main/Guide%20Resources/OpenIV/OpenIV.md

Make sure you have GTAV closed, as it might interfere with OpenIV.

Now that you have OpenIV installed, fire it up as administrator.

Now you select "Windows" from "Grand Theft Auto V", and let it do its job.

If OpenIV stops responing and freezes, you can just try again.

Now you should be on this window, but yours may differ, doesent really matter.

Now press Ctrl + F3 to bring up the search menu, and search for "mpstats".

Now extract all the files to a folder.

You can create a new folder for them to be extracted to.

Now it would look something like this:

You can delete the file ending with .ysc, because that is encrypted, and you dont know how to un-encrypt it yet.

And you can delete all the files that have the size of 1kb, because they are empty files with nothing useful in them.

Now you are left with some files, they contain all of the stats that you will ever need.

I reccomend you read thru the "READ THIS BEFORE STARTING" that "mpstatssetup(1).xml" typically has.
If you cant find it, I left it in:
https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/blob/main/Guide%20Resources/Stat%20Files/Stat%20File%20Read%20Me.md

Thats the basics of extracting stat files.
