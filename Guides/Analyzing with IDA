Analyzing the dump with IDA is easy.

If you dont have a game dump then follow the guide:
https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/blob/main/Guides/Dumping%20the%20game.md

For this you will need IDA. Luckily IDA Freeware is a thing, and you probably do not need IDA Pro yet.

Go and download IDA Freeware.

IDA Freeware: https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/#download

Now if you have set up IDA. Open it up.

WARNING: IDA CAN CRASH YOU COMPUTER, AND IT COULD BLUE SCREEN. DONT BE ALARMED. IT IS NORMAL.

Now disassemble a new file.
