Analyzing the dump with IDA is easy.

If you dont have a game dump then follow the guide:
https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/blob/main/Guides/Dumping%20the%20game.md

For this you will need IDA. Luckily IDA Freeware is a thing, and you probably do not need IDA Pro yet.

Go and download IDA Freeware.

IDA Freeware: https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/#download

And download the sigmaker plugins.

Sigmaker: https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/tree/main/Guide%20Resources/Sigmaker

Download both sigmaker.dll and sigmaker64.dll

Now that you have downloaded IDA and the dlls, go to IDA's file directory (where you download IDA to)

and drag the two sigmaker dlls into the plugins folder.

Now if you have set up IDA. Open it as administrator.

WARNING: IDA CAN CRASH YOU COMPUTER, AND IT COULD BLUE SCREEN. DONT BE ALARMED. IT IS NORMAL.

Now disassemble a new file.

Then open the dump, that you saved of the game. Should be named "GTA5_dump.exe", open it with IDA. And press Ok

Now IDA will take some time analyzing the dump, this takes some time, depending on how powerful your computer is.
If you have a computer with shit hardware, then its gonna take some time, but if you have high end stuff then it will be analyzed faster.

But we can still do things while its analyzing, so lets do some stuff.

If you have the goofy aah white theme, then you can change it to gigachad dark theme at Options > Colors... > Current theme

And turn that to "dark"

And press "Apply" and "Ok"

Now you got rid of the cringe white theme, you can check if you have the sigmaker plugin installed, 
by goind to Edit > Plugins > SigMaker.

Now click on "SigMaker" and a window like this should pop up:
