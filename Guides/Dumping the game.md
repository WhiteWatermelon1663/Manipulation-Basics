Sup!

Dumping the game is eazy.

Download the newest snapshot of x64dbg.

x64dbg: https://x64dbg.com/

MAKE SURE YOU DONT HAVE ANY MOD MENUS INJECTED! THEY WILL CLOSE IF YOU RUN X64DBG.<br>
X64DBG IS CONSIDERED AS A DEBUGGER TOOL AND MENUS DO NOT LIKE THAT!

Now you can run x64dbg as administrator.

Depends if you ran the x96dbg.exe or the x64dbg.exe,
if you ran x96dbg.exe, then choose x64dbg mode.

Also say yes to the questions on first launch of x64dbg.

If you dont have the game running, then start it and be in **SINGEL PLAYER**

MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN SINGEL PLAYER!!! DONT DO IT IN ONLINE!<br>
MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN SINGEL PLAYER!!! DONT DO IT IN ONLINE!<br>

Now click this little "S" icon at the top.

If for some reason there is no "S" icon there, then you will need to install the Scylla.dll manually.
If you have the "S" icon, then skip this.

You can download the dll at https://github.com/WhiteWatermelon1663/Manipulation-Basics/tree/main/Guide%20Resources/Scylla

and drag the Scylla.dll into the "x64dbg\release\x64" directory. It should look something like this:

Now click this drop down box.

Now find "GTA5.exe"

And press "Dump"

Now you need to save the dump somewhere, where you can access later, when you are going to analyze the dump.

Then you can close x64dbg.exe.

Thats the basics of dumping the game.
