Dumping the game is eazy, you will need to download.

Download the newest snapshot of x64dbg.

<span style="color:red;">MAKE SURE YOU DONT HAVE ANY MOD MENUS INJECTED! THEY WILL CLOSE IF YOU RUN X64DBG.</span>
<span style="color:red;">X64DBG IS CONSIDERED AS A DEBUGGER TOOL AND MENUS DO NOT LIKE THAT!</span>

Now you can run x64dbg as administrator.

Depends if you ran the x96dbg.exe or the x64dbg.exe,
if you ran x96dbg.exe, then choose x64dbg mode.

Also say yes to the questions on first launch of x64dbg.

If you dont have the game running, then start it and be in <span style="color:red;">SINGEL PLAYER</span>
